- The goal is to knock down all ten pins
- Each frame consists of throwing the ball twice to knock down all the pins
- If you knock down all the pins with the first ball, it is called a "strike"
- If you knock down all the pins with the second ball, it is called a "spare"
- Each games consists of ten frames. If you bowl a strike in the tenth frame, you get
   two more balls. If you throw a spare, you get one more ball.
- Open frames are frames without a strike or spare
- Scoring is based on the number of pins you knock down. However, if you bowl a
  spare, you get to add the pins in your next ball to that frame. For strikes, you get
  the next two balls.
- An average of three games is played. You determine a 3 game average by adding
  all 3 scores and then dividing that number by 3.
- Accurate preliminary scores are essential for fair divisioning.
- Foul line is in effect. If you step over the foul line, any pins knocked down will not
  count towards your score.
- Ramp Bowling is allowed for those athletes that are not physically capable of
  rolling a bowling ball. The ramp is for physical disabilities and not to be used to
  just increase a score.
- Bumpers are not allowed.

LANE ETIQUETTE
