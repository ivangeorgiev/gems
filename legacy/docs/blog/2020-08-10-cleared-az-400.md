# Cleared AZ-400 exam

Today I cleared the [AZ-400 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-400): Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions

Together with earlier Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator Associate certificate, I got the Microsoft [Certified DevOps Engineer Expert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/devops-engineer).
